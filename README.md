A simple console application or a quick clip game called Pacman Game in C was made for entertainment. Similar to the snake game, Pacman needs to be moved such that he travels along a predefined blue route before it is erased or eaten by Pacman. The game is easy to play and awards points for clearing paths as you go. Here you may get the source code and output screens for this project.
